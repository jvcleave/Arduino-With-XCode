### This is the Arduino and Sanguino on XCode3.2 help file ###

	The preferred place for help, discussion and suggestions is here:
	http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,49956.0.html


###	Quickstart

	To build the project press "Build"
	To clean the project press "Clean"
	To upload the project press "Clean All"


###	LIBRARIES
	
	All the standard libraries included in Arduino.app are already in the build settings under "ARDUINO_LIBRARIES". 
	You just need to #include them like you normally would.


###	To add another library:

1.	Drag the folder containing the library's .cpp and .h file onto XCode's project tree.
	A dialog pops up asking you about the way you want to add this folder.
	Uncheck "Copy items into destinations group's folder (if needed)".
	Choose "Absolute Path" as the Reference Type
	Click "Add"

2.	Right click the new folder in the Xcode project tree and choose "Get Info"
	Copy the Full Path.
	
3.  Go to Project > Edit Project Settings and click on the "Build" tab.
	In the "value" field for "LIBRARY_PATHS", paste the Full path you just copied.
	LIBRARY_PATHS is a space separated list. At the moment the paths in this list can't contain spaces.
	Don't try to add quotes around those paths, it won't work... Make has horrible problems with paths that contain spaces :-(
	(see here for more about that nonsense: http://www.cmcrossroads.com/ask-mr-make/7859-gnu-make-meets-file-names-with-spaces-in-them )
	Are also not allowed: paths that have ~/yourFolder instead of /Users/myUserName/yourFolder
	Paths should NOT end with a slash.


### FEEDBACK
	Is this not clear enough? Should we include something else? Can you help us make this project better?
	Let us know at the Arduino Forum!
